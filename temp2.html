<h1>Virat Kohli</h1>
 <p> Born in Delhi, Virat Kohli shot into prominence as the Under-19 skipper, who led India to victory at the 2008 World Cup held in Malaysia. That accolade gained him instant recognition and made him an overnight teen sensation. 
     Soon he made his ODI debut for India in Sri Lanka in August 2008 when he was thrust into the opener's role as both Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar were ruled out due to injuries. He played two important knocks - 37 in the 
	 second ODI and 54 in the fourth - both of which resulted in India winning, thereby enabling them to win the series as well. After such an impressive showing, he was slightly unlucky to remain on the bench when England visited 
	 India in December 2008, as Tendulkar and Sehwag had returned and the middle-order was strong and packed.Kohli, however, was not disappointed and he went back to the domestic scene and continued to plunder attacks playing for Delhi.
